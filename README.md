# freeCodeCamp Basejumps

*Note: Nowadays, basejumps are better known as "back end development projects."*

Basejumps, probably stemming from "[BASE jumping](http://www.basejumper.com/Articles/General/The_History_of_BASE_Jumping_657.html)," form the back-end of freeCodeCamp's curriculum. They are backend-oriented projects which have campers following specific but flexible user stories in order to build APIs and dynamic web applications.
